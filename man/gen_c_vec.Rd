\title{Symmetric boundaries for \eqn{W(T)/(T)^{1/2}}}
\usage{
gen_c_vec(t_vec, option, alphalevel = 0.05, phivalue = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{t_vec}{Timing vector of interim looks and final analysis in information fraction. For example,
a trial design of one interim look at half information and final analysis has \code{t_vec=c(0.5,1)}}

\item{option}{1 and 2 correspond to alpha spending functions which give O'Brien Fleming and Pocock
type boundaries, respectively. A value of 3 is the power family. See below for details.}

\item{alphalevel}{Type I error, default is 0.05.}

\item{phivalue}{value used when option=3 or 4 (See below).}
}
\value{
The vector of upper boundaries calculated, with same length as \code{t_vec}
}
